## What is this? 🤔

**The Idea Space** is a fan-made demon compendium inspired by the Shin Megami Tensei series. It's not a game, not an official tool—just a fun little project for fellow SMT nerds who want to browse demons, compare stats, and maybe learn some lore along the way.

Think of it as a digital museum for demons. Hee-ho! ❄️

## Features 📋

- 🕹️ **Classic SMT Aesthetic** - Retro terminal vibes with scanlines, glitch effects, and that old-school demon summoning program feel
- 📅 **Timeline View** - See how demons evolved across the series from SMT I (1992) to SMT V: Vengeance (2024)
- 🔍 **Filter & Search** - Sort by game, alignment (Law/Neutral/Chaos), race, tier ranking, and skill type
- 📖 **Demon Lore** - Read up on your favorite demons and their mythological origins
- 👹 **20 Iconic Demons** - From Jack Frost to Lucifer, Matador to Yoshitsune
- 🎯 **Tier Rankings** - See which demons are S-tier and which are... well, not

## Why? 🎯

Because SMT is awesome and demons deserve a cool place to hang out. That's it. That's the reason.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- HTML
- CSS (lots of CSS animations)
