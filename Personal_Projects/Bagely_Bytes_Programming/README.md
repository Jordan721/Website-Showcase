## 🎓 The Name — A Tribute

The name **"Bagely Bytes"** comes from **LC6 Bagel Bytes** 🥯 — the name my cohort gave ourselves in the **App Dev track at Year Up United**.

It's a fun nod to where my programming journey began and the amazing community that supported me along the way. This project is my way of giving back and helping others start their own coding journey!
