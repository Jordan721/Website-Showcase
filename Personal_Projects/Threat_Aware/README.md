## 💡 Why I Built This

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3oKIPnAiaMCws8nOsE/giphy.gif" alt="Learning" width="250"/>
</p>

The digital landscape has never been more dangerous. With new threats emerging every day—from sophisticated phishing schemes to AI-powered scams—it's becoming increasingly difficult for everyday people to stay safe online.

**I created this project because I believe that if I can help even one person recognize a threat before it's too late, it's worth it.**

Sometimes the best way to remember something is to teach it. By building this platform, I'm not just helping others learn—I'm reinforcing these critical safety habits for myself too.

> *"In cybersecurity, staying vigilant isn't a one-time thing; it's an ongoing practice."*
