## 🤔 What's This All About?

Hey there! 👋🏾 Welcome to my **Development Showcase** — a carefully curated gallery of websites and interactive projects I've created over the years. This isn't just another boring portfolio site; it's a visual journey through my growth as a developer!

From classroom assignments to professional bootcamp projects, each piece tells a story of learning, experimentation, and problem-solving. I wanted to create something that not only displays my work but does it with **style** and **modern flair**! 🤩
